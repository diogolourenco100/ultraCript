This is a base64 bulk encryptor/decryptor. Made to encode a word or phrase several times, in a specific number provided by the user.

It can also be used to crack base64 hashes using the decryptor, where there is no need to know how many times the hash has been encrypted.

Be careful when executing the code on values above 100 in the coding option, there may be locks and crashes in the system.
